#### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive and detailed dashboard for monitoring and managing devices enrolled with the Scalefusion Mobile Device Management (MDM) solution. The dashboard, developed using the Python Dash framework, will leverage Business Intelligence (BI) tools and techniques to provide insightful analytics and real-time data visualization, enhancing the management capabilities of IT administrators and business managers.

#### Objectives
1. **Real-Time Device Monitoring**: Implement real-time tracking and monitoring of devices to ensure timely updates on their status, location, and performance metrics.
2. **Usage Analytics**: Provide detailed usage analytics to understand how devices are being utilized, including app usage, data consumption, and user behavior patterns.
3. **Health and Performance Metrics**: Develop predictive models using AI to anticipate potential issues and provide insights into the health and performance of the devices.

#### Key Features
1. **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly and interactive dashboard built with Python Dash that provides a high-level overview as well as detailed insights into various aspects of device management.
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression) to predict the time left for a device to discharge until it reaches 30% battery.
3. **Data Visualizations**: Include various graphs and charts to present data, such as:
   - **Device Information Table**: Displaying essential details about each device.
   - **Battery History Consumption**: Historical data on battery consumption over time.
   - **Battery Charging and Discharging (Last 7 Days)**: Visualizing battery charging and discharging patterns over the last week.
   - **Device Usage Per Day (Last 7 Days)**: Showing the average time spent using the Scalefusion interface and the Android interface.
   - **Machine Learning Prediction**: Predicting the time left for the device to discharge until it reaches 30% battery using Linear Regression.

#### Technologies and Tools
1. **Framework**: Python Dash for developing the interactive dashboard.
2. **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for implementing Linear Regression models for predictive analytics.
3. **Data Visualization**: Plotly for creating interactive and visually appealing graphs and charts.
4. **Backend Development**: Python for server-side logic.
5. **MDM Integration**: APIs provided by Scalefusion MDM for accessing device data.
